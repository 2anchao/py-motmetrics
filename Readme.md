## py-motmetrics

The **py-motmetrics** library provides a Python implementation of metrics for benchmarking multiple object trackers (MOT). The results generated by this implementation are compatible with popular [MOTChallenge][MOTChallenge] benchmarks.

### Features at a glance
- *Variety of metrics* <br/>
Provides MOTA, MOTP, track quality measures and more (see below).
- *Distance agnostic* <br/>
Supports Euclidean, Intersection over Union and other distances measures.
- *Complete event history* <br/> 
Tracks all relevant per-frame events suchs as correspondences, misses, false alarms and switches.
- *Easy to adapt* <br/> 
Events and summaries are utilizing [pandas][pandas] for data structures and analysis.

### Metrics

**py-motmetrics** implements the following metrics. The metrics have been aligned with what is reported by [MOTChallenge][MOTChallenge] benchmarks.

Metric  | Unit   | Description |
------- | ------ | ----------- |
Frames  | Count  | Total number of frames|
Match  | Count  | Total number matches|
Switch  | Count  | Total number track switches (see [[1]](#References))|
FalsePos  | Count  | Total number false positive hypothesis (see [[1]](#References))|
Miss  | Count  | Total number missed objects (see [[1]](#References))|
MOTP  | Distance  | Multiple Object Tracking Precision. Average distance error of correctly detected objects (see [[1]](#References)). Note, MOTChallenge compatibility is given by `MOTP=1-MOTP`, distance IoU with threshold 0.5|
MOTA  | Percentage  | Multiple object tracking accuracy (see [[1]](#References)). Accounts for object configuration errors of tracker.|
|Precision | Percentage | Percent of correct detections to total tracker detections (see [[2]](#References)).|
|Recall | Percentage | Percent of correct detections to total number of objects (see [[2]](#References)).|
|Frag | Count | Total number of track fragmentations (see [[2,3]](#References)). |
|Objs | Count | Total number unique objects. |
|MT | Count | Mostly tracked objects (see [[2,3]](#References)). Count of trajectories covered by hypothesis for at least 80% of track-lifespan.|
|PT | Count | Partially tracked objects (see [[2,3]](#References)). Count of trajectories covered by hypothesis between 20% and 80% of track-lifespan. |
|ML | Count | Mostly lost objects (see [[2,3]](#References)). Count of trajectories covered by hypothesis for less than 20% of track-lifespan.|
