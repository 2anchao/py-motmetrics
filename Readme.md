## CLEAR MOT metrics

The **py-clearmot** library provides a Python implementation of CLEAR MOT metrics for evaluation object tracker performances based on 

> Bernardin, Keni, and Rainer Stiefelhagen.
> "Evaluating multiple object tracking performance: the CLEAR MOT metrics." 

Features at a glance
- Distance agnostic. Supports Euclidean, Intersection over Union and other distances measures.
- Complete event history. Tracks all relevant per-frame events suchs as correspondences, misses, false alarms and switches. 
- Uses Python [pandas][pandas] for data structures and analysis.
- Supports MOTA and MOTP metrics.
- Global minimum cost assignments are accomplished through Kuhn-Munkres algorithm.

## Usage

```python
import clearmot as cm

# TODO
```

### Installation
To install **py-clearmot** clone this repository and use `pip` to install
from local sources.

```
pip install -e <path/to/setup.py>
```

Python 3.5/3.6 and numpy, pandas and scipy is required.
