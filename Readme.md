## py-motmetrics

The **py-motmetrics** library provides a Python implementation of metrics for benchmarking multiple object trackers (MOT). The results generated by this implementation are compatible with popular [MOTChallenge][MOTChallenge] benchmarks.

Features at a glance
- *Variety of metrics* <br/>
Provides MOTA, MOTP, track quality measures and more (see below).
- *Distance agnostic* <br/>
Supports Euclidean, Intersection over Union and other distances measures.
- *Complete event history* <br/> 
Tracks all relevant per-frame events suchs as correspondences, misses, false alarms and switches.
- *Easy to adapt* <br/> 
Events and summaries are utilizing [pandas][pandas] for data structures and analysis.

### Usage

```python
import motmetrics as mm

# TODO
```
