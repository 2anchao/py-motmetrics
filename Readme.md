## py-motmetrics

The **py-motmetrics** library provides a Python implementation of metrics for benchmarking multiple object trackers (MOT).

While benchmarking single object trackers is rather straightforward, measuring the performance of multiple object trackers needs careful thinking as multiple correspondence constellation can arise (see image below). A variety of methods has been proposed in the past and while there is no general agreement, the methods of [[1,2,3]](#References) have received considerable attention in recent years. 

**py-motmetrics** provides these suggested metrics. The results generated by this implementation are compatible with popular [MOTChallenge][MOTChallenge] benchmarks.

### Metrics

**py-motmetrics** implements the following metrics. The metrics have been aligned with what is reported by [MOTChallenge][MOTChallenge] benchmarks.

Metric  | Unit   | Description |
------- | ------ | ----------- |
Frames  | Count  | Total number of frames|
Match  | Count  | Total number matches|
Switch  | Count  | Total number track switches (see [[1]](#References))|
FalsePos  | Count  | Total number false positive hypothesis (see [[1]](#References))|
Miss  | Count  | Total number missed objects (see [[1]](#References))|
MOTP  | Distance  | Multiple Object Tracking Precision. Average distance error of correctly detected objects (see [[1]](#References)). Note, MOTChallenge compatibility is given by `MOTP=1-MOTP`, distance IoU with threshold 0.5|
MOTA  | Percentage  | Multiple object tracking accuracy (see [[1]](#References)). Accounts for object configuration errors of tracker.|
|Precision | Percentage | Percent of correct detections to total tracker detections (see [[2]](#References)).|
|Recall | Percentage | Percent of correct detections to total number of objects (see [[2]](#References)).|
|Frag | Count | Total number of track fragmentations (see [[2,3]](#References)). |
|Objs | Count | Total number unique objects. |
|MT | Count | Mostly tracked objects (see [[2,3]](#References)). Count of trajectories covered by hypothesis for at least 80% of track-lifespan.|
|PT | Count | Partially tracked objects (see [[2,3]](#References)). Count of trajectories covered by hypothesis between 20% and 80% of track-lifespan. |
|ML | Count | Mostly lost objects (see [[2,3]](#References)). Count of trajectories covered by hypothesis for less than 20% of track-lifespan.|

### Usage

#### Populating the accumulator

```python
import motmetrics as mm

# Create an accumulator that will be updated during each frame
acc = mm.MOTAccumulator(auto_id=True)

# Call update once for per frame. For now, assume distances are between
# frame objects / hypotheses are given.
acc.update(
    ['a', 'b'],                 # Ground truth objects in this frame
    [1, 2, 3],                  # Detector hypotheses in this frame
    [
        [0.1, np.nan, 0.3],     # Distances from object 'a' to hypotheses 1, 2, 3
        [0.5,  0.2,   0.3]      # Distances from object 'b' to hypotheses 1, 2, 3
    ]
)
```

The code above updates an event accumulator with data from a single frame. Here we assume that pairwise object / hypothesis distance have already been computed. Note the `np.nan` inside the distance matrix. It signals that `a` cannot be paired with hypothesis `2`. To inspect the current event state simple print the events associated with the accumulator

```python
print(acc.events) # a pandas DataFrame
"""
                Type  OId HId    D
FrameId Event
0       0      MATCH    a   1  0.1
        1      MATCH    b   2  0.2
        2         FP  NaN   3  NaN
"""
```

Meaning object `a` was matched to hypothesis `1` with distance 0.1. Similarily, `b` was matched to `2` with distance 0.2. Hypothesis `3` could not be matched to any remaining object and generated a false positive (FP).

Continuing from above
```python
df = acc.update(
    ['a', 'b'],
    [1],
    [
        [0.2], 
        [0.4]
    ]
)
print(df)
"""
0      MATCH   a    1  0.2
1       MISS   b  NaN  NaN
"""
```

While `a` was matched, `b` couldn't be matched because of lacking hypotheses.

```python
df = acc.update(
    ['a', 'b'],
    [1, 3],
    [
        [0.6, 0.2],
        [0.1, 0.6]
    ]
)
print(df)
"""
0       MATCH   a   1  0.6
1      SWITCH   b   3  0.6
"""
```
`b` is now tracked by hypothesis `3` leading to a track switch.

#### Computing metrics
Once the accumulator has been populated you can compute and display metrics. Continuing the example from above

```python
summary = mm.metrics.summarize(acc)
print(mm.io.render_summary(summary))
"""
   Frames  Match  Switch  FalsePos  Miss  MOTP   MOTA Precision Recall  Frag  Objs  MT  PT  ML
0       3      4       1         1     1 0.340 50.00%    83.33% 83.33%     1     2   1   1   0
"""

# Summarize multiple accumulators or accumulator parts
summaries = mm.metrics.summarize([acc, acc.events.loc[0:1]], names=['full', 'part'])
print(mm.io.render_summary(summaries))
"""
      Frames  Match  Switch  FalsePos  Miss  MOTP   MOTA Precision Recall  Frag  Objs  MT  PT  ML
full       3      4       1         1     1 0.340 50.00%    83.33% 83.33%     1     2   1   1   0
part       2      3       0         1     1 0.167 50.00%    75.00% 75.00%     0     2   1   1   0
"""
```

#### Computing distances
Up until this point we assumed the pairwise object/hypothesis distances to be known. Usually this is not the case. You are mostly given either rectangles or points (centroids) of related
objects. To compute a distance matrix from them you can use `motmetrics.distance` module as shown below.

##### Euclidean norm squared on points

```python
# Object related points
o = np.array([
    [1., 2],
    [2., 2],
    [3., 2],
])

# Hypothesis related points
h = np.array([
    [0., 0],
    [1., 1],      
])

C = mm.distances.norm2squared_matrix(o, h, max_d2=5.)
"""
[[  5.   1.]
 [ nan   2.]
 [ nan   5.]]
"""
```

##### Intersection over union norm for 2D rectangles
```python
a = np.array([
    [0, 0, 20, 100],    # Format X, Y, Width, Height
    [0, 0, 0.8, 1.5],
])

b = np.array([
    [0, 0, 1, 2],
    [0, 0, 1, 1],
    [0.1, 0.2, 2, 2],
])
mm.distances.iou_matrix(a, b, max_iou=0.5)
"""
[[ 0.          0.5                nan]
 [ 0.4         0.42857143         nan]]
"""
```
